                <h2>Reflection</h2>It is important to consider all factors while making a website, and from the two methods using XML editor and sites.psu; it is easy to identify that sites.psu is a user-friendly platform that allows even the most technologically challenged individuals to create stunning websites with ease. XML editors, on the other hand, are clunky, code-heavy tools that require extensive knowledge of programming and markup languages. As with sites.psu you can choose from a wide range of templates and customize them using a simple drag-and-drop interface. You don't need to worry about writing complex code or dealing with the error and such of XML. sites.psu takes care of all the technical aspects, allowing you to focus on designing a visually appealing and functional website. Whereas XML editors require you to manually write XML code, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. You need to have a deep understanding of XML syntax and structure, and even a small mistake can cause the entire website to break. But XML editor grants more flexibility and control over the website's structure and design. It allows for precise markup and customization, which can be beneficial for individuals with advanced coding skills or specific requirements that cannot be easily achieved with template-based platforms like sites.psu. Therefore, it depends on the user on what type of editor they want to use, but for me I liked the <strong><em>Pennstate</em> </strong>editor as it is very easy to work with and offers professional results.
